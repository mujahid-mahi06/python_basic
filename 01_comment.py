# Comments are those line which are not read by the 'IDE'

# We can make comments in Python

# This way is used to make comment for single line :
        # We should use '#' sign before the line
        # Then the line will be performed as a comment
        
# This is way is used to make multiline comment or 'docstring' :
        # To make a multiline comment we have to use 3 times {single(')}
        # Or 3 times {double(")} quotation sign at the start 
        # And at the end
        # (''') or (""")
     
        
# Example :

    # Single quote (')
    
'''
Hey i am X.
I Love python so much!
''' 

    # Double quote (")
    
"""
Hey I am Y.
I Love python Too!
"""

# Because in this file, every line is comment,

# That's why no line will be executed

# This is all about comments in Python

# This is the End

# Successfully mastered comments in python
