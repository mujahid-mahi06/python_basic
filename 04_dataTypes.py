# Data Types in python are so much important

# There are 5 main Data Types
    # Strings   ('a,b,c')
        # Everything inside single or double quotation sign
    # Integer   (1,2,3)
        # Solid Numbers without quotation sign
    # Float    (2.2, 3.5, 23.233)
        # Floating numbers without quotation sign
    # Boolean   (True, False)
        # It's an indicator of is the statement is right or wrong
        # If right Then it's 'True'
        # If not Then it's 'False'
        # Only Have two possible values
    # NoneType  (None)
        # None is like an variable assigned with None Keyword
        # Means It's not str, int, float or bool or anything
        # It's a data which express it has no data
        
# There are a lot more data types in python
    # Complex   (2j, 34j)
    # Bytes     (b'hello')

# THere are more left
# But not that necessary at the beginning level
# I may learn them in future

# Final Recap of Data Types    

# String (str)
print(type('Mujahid Al Mahi'))    # 'str' cuz inside quotation sign

# Integer (int)
print(type(123))      # 'int' cuz not inside quotation sign & a solid number

# Float (float)
print(type(25.43))      # 'float' cuz not inside quotation sign & a floating number

# Boolean (bool)
# 'bool' cuz not inside quotation sign and a value of 'True' or 'False'
print(type(True)) 
print(type(False))

# NoneType (none)
print(type(None))       # 'none' cuz not inside of quotation sign and a value of 'None'

# Complex ('complex')
# Complex in python is a mix of real & imaginary value
# complex = real + imaginary(j)
print(type(2 + 5j))     # Here 2 , 5 is real but 'j' is imaginary
# A lot more left to learn about complex
# I will learn them later

# Bytes (bytes)
print(type(b'Hello'))       # 'bytes' cuz has a 'b' at the beginning
# Not that important
# I may learn them later
