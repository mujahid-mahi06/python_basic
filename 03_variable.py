# A Variable is a container which holds the value

# In Python There is no keyword for declaring a variable

# Variable is assigned with 'equal' sign(=)

# It can contain anything

# A variable can be printed by the print function
    # Without any quotation mark
    
# Syntax :
    # variable_name = value
    
# Naming a variable is an important thing

    # Python is case-sensitive
        # name, Name, NaMe, namE all are different variable name

    # Syntax of naming A Variable :
        # Can't Have a Space (' ')
        # Can't have any special character (!, @, #, $, %, ^, &, ., * etc)
        # Can' have any reserved words (and, if, def, while, for etc)
        # Can't Start With any number (int or float)
        # But can have underscore ('_')
        # Can start with alphabet (A-Z, a-z) & underscore('_')
        # It can contain alphabet, number & underscore
        # example of right name :
            # _name
            # name
            # name06
            # name_004
            # name45_
            # Name123_name_232
        # example of wrong name
            # name 123(have space)
            # name$(have special character)
            # for(have keyword)
            # 123name(have number at the beginning)

    # Three ways to name a python variable:
        # Camel Case
            #myName
        # Pascal Case
            #MyName
        # Snake Case
            # my_name          
# This is all about naming a variable

# now let's create a valid variable 
my_name = 'Mujahid Al Mahi'  # This is the first variable

# Multiple variable = Multiple Value
_name, _age, _hobby = 'mahi', 17, 'coding'   # We can print any of these variable

# Multiple Variable = One Value
name1 = name2 = name3 = 'mahi'           # all these variables have 'mahi' value

# scope of a variable
place = 'narayanganj'       # global scope
# But some variables are created in the functions
# Those are Local scope
# They can only be used inside that function



# Haha quite hard?
# We mastered the variable stuffs
# This is the end ((((((((((((((()))))))))))))))
